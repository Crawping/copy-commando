# file_copy

TeraCopy is a great tool, the problem is that it lacks performance , the release is buggy (crashes when trying to copy >100K files or so) and the last release was years ago.
Besides that, it's a paid tool.

In order to solve these problems, I've decided to create this alternative (in c++ with WTL), which I've made open-source due to lack for continuing on it.
